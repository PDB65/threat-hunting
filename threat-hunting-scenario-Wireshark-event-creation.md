# Threat Event: Unauthorized Install and Usage of Wireshark

Incident: An internal or external bad actor installed Wireshark on a corporate VM with the intention of capturing internal network traffic, potentially to extract sensitive data or bypass network monitoring tools.

Policy: For employees of the organization, there is a policy against installing packet capture tools and aims to identify and investigate potential insider threats or policy violations.

---





## The actions of the internal or external threat:
1. Download Wireshark from the website: https://www.wireshar.org 
2. Located the file: ```Wireshark-4.4.6-x64.exe```
3. Copy the file to the Temp folder: â€œC:\Temp\Wireshark-4.4.6-x64.exe"
4. Delete the file in the download folder to give the impression that the file was deleted and not used.



   - **WARNING: The links to onion sites change a lot and these have changed. However if you connect to Tor and browse around normal sites a bit, the necessary logs should still be created:**
   - Current Dread Forum: ```dreadytofatroptsdj6io7l3xptbet6onoyno2yv7jicoxknyazubrad.onion```
   - Dark Markets Forum: ```dreadytofatroptsdj6io7l3xptbet6onoyno2yv7jicoxknyazubrad.onion/d/DarkNetMarkets```
   - Current Elysium Market: ```elysiumutkwscnmdohj23gkcyp3ebrf4iio3sngc5tvcgyfp4nqqmwad.top/login```

5. Create a folder on your desktop called ```tor-shopping-list.txt``` and put a few fake (illicit) items in there
6. Delete the file.
